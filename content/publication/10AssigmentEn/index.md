abstract: This summary covers the fundamental concepts of steganography, which is defined as the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that their very existence is concealed from anyone other than the intended recipient. This method provides security through obscurity and is distinctly different from cryptography, which only obscures the meaning of a message but does not hide the message itself. The primary advantage of steganography is that its messages do not attract attention or arouse suspicion.
