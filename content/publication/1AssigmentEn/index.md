abstract: This quiz evaluates foundational knowledge of computer systems, focusing on their core components—input devices, processor, output devices, and storage—alongside the historical progression from vacuum tubes to transistors and VLSI technology. It also examines device classification (e.g., calculators as computers), component functionalities (e.g., transistors), and distinctions between early computer generations, such as mainframe and mini computers.
